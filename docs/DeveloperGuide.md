### Architecture

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureDiagram.puml" width="280"></puml>

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.
* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.puml" width="574"></puml>

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<puml src="diagrams/ComponentManagers.puml" width="300"></puml>

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

<puml src="diagrams/UiClassDiagram.puml" alt="Structure of the UI Component"><puml>

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<puml src="diagrams/LogicClassDiagram.puml" width="550"></puml>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete 1")` API call as an example.

<puml src="diagrams/DeleteSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command"></puml>

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.
</box>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `AddressBookParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a person).<br>
   Note that although this is shown as a single step in the diagram above (for simplicity), in the code it can take several interactions (between the command object and the `Model`) to achieve.
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<puml src="diagrams/ParserClasses.puml" width="600"></puml>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class determines the command word and creates the appropriate parser (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, or simpler ones like `ClearCommandParser`, `ListCommandParser`). This specific parser uses the other utility classes shown above to parse the arguments (if any) and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* Parsers for commands requiring specific arguments (like `AddCommandParser`) also provide detailed error messages if mandatory prefixes are missing, while `EditCommandParser` success message confirms with the user the edited fields.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser` `ClearCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<puml src="diagrams/ModelClassDiagram.puml" width="450"></puml>


The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user’s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* Provides methods to check for potential timeslot conflicts (`getConflictingPerson`), abstracting this logic away from individual commands
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Person` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<puml src="diagrams/BetterModelClassDiagram.puml" width="450"></puml>

</box>


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<puml src="diagrams/StorageClassDiagram.puml" width="550"></puml>

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.address.commons` package.

## **Implementation**

This section provides an overview of the key implementation details for major features and design improvements. Each subsection highlights the rationale, core logic, and design considerations behind the feature, with reference diagrams where appropriate.

### \[Implemented\] `filtertimeslot` feature

#### Proposed Implementation

The `filtertimeslot` feature allows users to filter the displayed list of persons to only those whose timeslots fall within a specified date and/or time range. This mechanism is facilitated by a new `TimeslotRangePredicate` class.

The `FilterTimeslotCommand`'s `execute` method passes this predicate to the `Model`'s `updateFilteredPersonList(predicate)` method. The `ModelManager` then uses this predicate to update its `FilteredList`, which in turn updates the UI.

The `FilterTimeslotCommandParser` is responsible for parsing the user's input, which must contain at least one of the four optional prefixes: `sd/` (start date), `ed/` (end date), `st/` (start time), and `et/` (end time). It also supports the keywords now and today (e.g., `sd/today`, `st/now`) for date and time fields to filter relative to the current system time.These are used to construct the `TimeslotRangePredicate` which contains the logic to check if a `Person`'s `TimeSlot` overlaps with the specified range.

The following sequence diagram shows how a `filtertimeslot` operation goes through the components:

<puml src="diagrams/FilterTimeslotSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="FilterTimeslotSequenceDiagram"></puml>

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How to parse the filter parameters:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use flexible, optional prefixes (e.g., `sd/`, `st/`, `et/`).
    * Pros: Highly flexible. Allows users to filter by just a start time (`st/0900`), just a date range (`sd/2025-10-20 ed/2025-10-22`), or a specific time on a specific day (`sd/2025-10-20 st/0900 et/1700`).
    * Cons: Parsing logic is more complex as many combinations are valid.

* **Alternative 2:** A single, fixed-format argument (e.g., `filtertimeslot YYYY-MM-DD to YYYY-MM-DD`).
    * Pros: Very simple to parse.
    * Cons: Much less flexible. It's difficult to filter for "all 9am-12pm slots on any date," which is a key use case.

**Aspect: Handling of Relative Time ("Now"/"Today")**

* **Alternative 1 (Current Choice):** Special keywords (`now`, `today`) used as *values* for existing date/time prefixes (`sd/`, `st/`, etc.).
    * **Pros:** Highly flexible and **composable**. Allows combining relative times with specific dates/times (e.g., `sd/now ed/2025-11-30`). Consistent with the existing prefix-based command structure.
    * **Cons:** Requires slightly more complex logic within the parser to detect and handle these keywords.
* **Alternative 2:** Introduce a dedicated, mutually exclusive prefix or flag (e.g., `filtertimeslot /future` or `filtertimeslot mode=future`).
    * **Pros:** Might seem conceptually simpler for a single use case (like "show only future slots").
    * **Cons:** Much less flexible. Cannot be easily combined with other date/time filters. Adds complexity to the parser to handle mutual exclusion rules. Violates the consistency of using prefixes for parameters.

**Aspect: Definition of Time Range Overlap**

* **Alternative 1 (Current Choice):** Overlap requires actual intersection of time intervals. Slots ending exactly when the filter starts, or starting exactly when the filter ends, are *not* considered overlapping.
    * **Pros:** Mathematically clear definition of overlap.
    * **Cons:** May not match user intuition for back-to-back schedules (e.g., filter `et/1000` might not include a person scheduled `1000-1100`).
* **Alternative 2:** Inclusive boundaries. Consider slots overlapping if they touch at the boundaries (e.g., filter `et/1000` *would* include `1000-1100`).
    * **Pros:** Catches adjacent schedules, potentially matching user expectation better.
    * **Cons:** Requires careful adjustment of the boundary checking logic in `TimeslotRangePredicate` (e.g., using `!isBefore` instead of `isAfter` and `!isAfter` instead of `isBefore`).

### \[Implemented\] `clearpast` feature

#### Proposed Implementation

The `clearpast` feature introduces an intelligent cleanup mechanism to manage outdated or recurring timeslots which is specifically designed for tutors. It iterates through the entire person list and performs actions on contacts whose timeslots are in the past (i.e., `TimeSlot.isPast(LocalDateTime.now())` is true).

The command follows two main logic paths:
1.  **Non-recurring contacts:** If a past contact does **not** have the `t/recurring` tag, it is deleted from the `Model` using `model.deletePerson()`.
2.  **Recurring contacts:** If a past contact **has** the `t/recurring` tag, the command calculates its next weekly occurrence using `TimeSlot.getNextOccurrence(now)`. It then attempts to update the contact with the new timeslot using `model.setPerson()`.

This `execute` method is designed to be "all-or-nothing" for each contact but not for the whole command. It builds lists of successfully deleted, successfully updated, and failed-to-update (conflicted) contacts and presents this summary to the user in the `CommandResult`.

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** Conflict handling is critical. When `clearpast` calls `model.setPerson()` with a recurring contact's new timeslot, the `ModelManager`'s `setPerson` logic handles the conflict check. If the new timeslot is already taken, `setPerson` throws a `TimeSlotConflictException` which contains details about the conflicting person. The `ClearPastCommand` catches this specific exception, formats a detailed error message including the conflicting person's name and timeslot, adds this to the `conflictNames` list, and continues processing the rest of the contacts.

</box>

At the end of the operation, `clearpast` forces the UI to refresh and re-sort by the default timeslot order by calling `model.updateFilteredPersonList(PREDICATE_SHOW_ALL_PERSONS)`.

The following activity diagram summarizes the logic flow for the `clearpast` command:

<puml src="diagrams/HighLevelClearPastActivityDiagram.puml" alt="HighLevelClearPastActivityDiagram"></puml>

Detailed Logic Flow for `clearpast`

<puml src="diagrams/ClearPastActivityDiagram.puml" alt="ClearPastActivityDiagram"></puml>

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How to handle recurring timeslots:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** A manual `clearpast` command that checks for a `t/recurring` tag.
    * Pros: Simple to implement and understand. The user retains full control over when their schedule is cleaned up. Fits well within a command-line application.
    * Cons: The user needs to remember to run the command. Only supports one type of recurrence (weekly).

* **Alternative 2:** A fully abstract `Schedule` class with `OneTimeSlot` and `RecurringSlot` subclasses.
    * Pros: Far more powerful. Could support complex schedules (e.g., "every Monday and Wednesday"). The `list` command could show all future occurrences.
    * Cons: Massive architectural change. It would require rewriting all time-based commands (`add`, `edit`, `findtimeslot`, `filtertimeslot`, `list` sorting) and the conflict detection logic.

* **Alternative 3:** An automatic background service that "watches" the clock.
    * Pros: Fully automated.
    * Cons: Not feasible for a simple command-line application. It's impossible to resolve conflicts (like in Alternative 1) without user input, leading to data being lost or updates failing silently.

**Aspect: Conflict Resolution Strategy for Recurring Slots**

* **Alternative 1 (Current Choice):** Report conflict and skip update for that specific contact.
    * **Pros:** Safe, prevents accidental data loss or overwriting. Provides clear feedback to the user about which updates failed.
    * **Cons:** Requires the user to manually resolve the conflict later. The address book can be left in a partially updated state.
* **Alternative 2:** Force overwrite. Delete the conflicting contact to make space for the recurring one.
    * **Pros:** Ensures the recurring appointment is always scheduled. Fully automated.
    * **Cons:** High risk of unintended data loss. Could be confusing for the user.
* **Alternative 3:** Automatic rescheduling. Find the *next available* slot for the recurring contact.
    * **Pros:** Attempts to preserve both contacts.
    * **Cons:** Complex logic. The recurring contact might end up scheduled at an unexpected time.

**Aspect: Granularity of Operation (All-or-Nothing)**

* **Alternative 1 (Current Choice):** Process each past contact individually. Deletions happen, and updates happen or fail one by one.
    * **Pros:** Robust against errors. If one update fails, others can still succeed. Provides detailed feedback.
    * **Cons:** The command is not atomic. State might be inconsistent until conflicts are resolved.
* **Alternative 2:** Transactional approach. If *any* update caused a conflict, the *entire* command would fail and make no changes.
    * **Pros:** Ensures the address book state remains consistent.
    * **Cons:** Less user-friendly if one conflict prevents many valid changes. More complex to implement.

### General Design Improvements

Beyond specific features, several architectural improvements were made to enhance code quality, maintainability, and user experience across the application.

#### Smarter Conflict Detection (in `Model`)

To adhere to the **Single Level of Abstraction (SLA)** principle, the business logic for detecting timeslot conflicts and duplicate persons is centralized within the `Model` component, specifically in `ModelManager#addPerson` and `ModelManager#setPerson`. Commands like `AddCommand` and `EditCommand` now delegate these checks to the `Model`. They simply call the appropriate `Model` method and handle any `TimeSlotConflictException` or `DuplicatePersonException` that arises. This separation makes the commands simpler and ensures consistent validation logic.

#### Safer & Consistent Commands (Argument Handling)

To improve user experience and ensure consistent command behavior, commands that are not designed to accept arguments (such as `clear`, `list`, `exit`, and `help`) now utilize dedicated parsers (e.g., `ClearCommandParser`, `ListCommandParser`). These parsers strictly check for the absence of arguments and throw a `ParseException` if any unexpected input is provided after the command word. This prevents potentially confusing situations (e.g., `list 123` silently ignoring "123") and provides immediate, clear feedback to the user, adhering to the principle of least surprise.

### \[Proposed\] Undo/redo feature

#### Proposed Implementation

The proposed undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedAddressBook`. It extends `AddressBook` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `addressBookStateList` and `currentStatePointer`. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedAddressBook#commit()` — Saves the current address book state in its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#undo()` — Restores the previous address book state from its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#redo()` — Restores a previously undone address book state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` and `Model#redoAddressBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedAddressBook` will be initialized with the initial address book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single address book state.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState0.puml" alt="UndoRedoState0"></puml>

Step 2. The user executes `delete 3` command to delete the 3rd person in the address book. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing the modified state of the address book after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `addressBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted address book state.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState1.puml" alt="UndoRedoState1"></puml>

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David …​` to add a new person. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing another modified address book state to be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState2.puml" alt="UndoRedoState2"></puml>

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, so the address book state will not be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

</box>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoAddressBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous address book state, and restores the address book to that state.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState3.puml" alt="UndoRedoState3"></puml>


<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial AddressBook state, then there are no previous AddressBook states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather
than attempting to perform the undo.

</box>

The following sequence diagram shows how an undo operation goes through the `Logic` component:

<puml src="diagrams/UndoSequenceDiagram-Logic.puml" alt="UndoSequenceDiagram-Logic"></puml>

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</box>

Similarly, how an undo operation goes through the `Model` component is shown below:

<puml src="diagrams/UndoSequenceDiagram-Model.puml" alt="UndoSequenceDiagram-Model"></puml>

The `redo` command does the opposite — it calls `Model#redoAddressBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the address book to that state.

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `addressBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest address book state, then there are no undone AddressBook states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

</box>

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the address book, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` or `Model#redoAddressBook()`. Thus, the `addressBookStateList` remains unchanged.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState4.puml" alt="UndoRedoState4"></puml>

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `addressBookStateList`, all address book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. Reason: It no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David …​` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState5.puml" alt="UndoRedoState5"></puml>

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

<puml src="diagrams/CommitActivityDiagram.puml" width="250"></puml>

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How undo & redo executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book.
  * Pros: Easy to implement.
  * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by
  itself.
  * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
  * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.
